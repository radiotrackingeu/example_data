# example_data
This repository contains a dataset recorded with the radio-tracking.eu system.

The sqlite file provided was created and can be viewed with the rteu logger app. 

Besides the actual received signals it also contains information about the tags used in this test, as well as the tracking stations.

While the list of tags contains several different tags, only P.Aur_5 was active in this test. So, when filtering, this tag/frequency must be selected.
